# Single Region Example

With this option, a single Agentless scanner is deployed in a single region. Datadog recommends this option. However, this option can incur higher costs, as it requires each Agentless scanner to perform cross-region scans per account.

To deploy in a single region, see the [example](multi_region/README.md).

# Multi Region Example

With this option, Agentless scanners are deployed on a single cloud account and are distributed across multiple regions within the account. With this deployment model, Agentless scanners are granted visibility without needing to perform cross-region scans, which are expensive in practice.

To deploy in multiple regions, see the [example](multi_region/README.md).

# Cross Account Example

With this option, an Agentless scanner is deployed in a single or multi-region set-up on a single account.
You don't need to deploy the scanner in any of your other accounts. Instead, a single delegate role is created that allows the scanner access to that account.

To scan across accounts, see the [example](cross_account/README.md)

# Custom VPC Example

If you want to avoid creating a new VPC for the Agentless scanners, and you want to reuse one of your own, see the [example](custom_vpc/README.md)
